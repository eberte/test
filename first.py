# This if my first time using git

print("Hello")
x = 5
y = 4

# We want to print x and y
print(x, y)


# Why did you try and add x y and not make a function?
def sum(x, y):
    return x+y


# We've now got some new code. I'm becoming very frustrated.


def difference(x, y):
    return x - y


# Yup, you're driving me mad because you don't know what you are doing.

def product(x, y):
    return x*y

# Is this good enough for you? Are you less angry now?
